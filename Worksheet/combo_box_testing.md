### Combo box testing

Check that clicking the new combo box's drop button causes the com port name(s) to appear in it.   

If applicable, try removing/inserting/enabling any COM Ports and check that the combo box updates correctly. 

The text "NO COM PORTS FOUND" will be displayed in the combo on a PC with no COM Ports available.  

Text defined in declarations section `Public Const TEXT_NO_COM_PORTS As String = "NO COM PORTS FOUND"`
